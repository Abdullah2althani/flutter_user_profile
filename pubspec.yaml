  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/1.jpg
    - images/2.jpg
    - images/3.jpg
    - images/4.jpg
    - images/5.jpg
    - images/6.jpg
    - images/p1.jpg
    - images/p2.jpg
    - images/p3.jpg
    - images/p4.jpg
    - images/p5.jpg
    - images/user_1.jpg
    - images/user_2.jpg
    - images/user_3.jpg
    - images/user_4.jpg
    - images/user_5.jpg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Cabin
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Cabin-Bold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Cabin-Medium.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Cabin-Regular.ttf
          style: italic
    - family: Josefin
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/JosefinSans-Bold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/JosefinSans-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/JosefinSans-Light.ttf
